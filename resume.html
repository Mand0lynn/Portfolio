      <h1>Resume</h1>
      <p>
        I’m an Information Technology student focused on cybersecurity, building on over 15 years of leadership experience at Microsoft and AWS. My background includes strategic planning, program development, and leading cross-functional teams through complex, high-impact work. I’ve implemented compliance initiatives, streamlined operations, and delivered data-informed solutions that drive results. Today, I’m combining that experience with hands-on technical training to grow as a cybersecurity professional—with a focus on ethical systems, security, and long-term impact.
